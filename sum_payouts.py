I tried reading the penalty calculation page for revenue canada and I have no idea what math they are doing.
I do have a lot of unused rrsp contribution room, and if I use some or all of that I should be able to bring my taxes down fairly low.
Surely they can only charge me interest on the actual tax I owe, not the amount they estimated based on last year?
I will say they could make this a lot more fucking obvious.
There is a line on the 2023 return, in the summary, that shows installments due in the coming year.
It is buried in a tiny paragraph at the end of page 3 in my 6 page notice of assessment. 
I feel like something that important should maybe be up top, in bigger font.
Especially when it's a change from the previous year.
I have gotten all notices by email for years, but in this case I wish it had been paper mail. I would have seen that.
I did have notice reminders, unopened in my inbox when I searched. I can't explain why I never saw them ðŸ˜¦
But I saw literally none of them, so maybe they were being filtered somehow.
